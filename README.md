# Self-Drive-Car-Implemention-Using-Keras
In a new automotive application, we have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to map the raw pixels from a front-facing camera to the steering commands for a self-driving car. This powerful end-to-end approach means that with minimum training data from humans, the system learns to steer, with or without lane markings, on both local roads and highways. The system can also operate in areas with unclear visual guidance such as parking lots or unpaved roads.  In this Project i am going to implement Nvidia End-to-End Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars" Network Architecture(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf) and around 45,000 Data-set(https://github.com/SullyChen/driving-datasets)
